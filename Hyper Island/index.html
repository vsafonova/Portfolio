                    <h3 class="lead">
                        With the rise of users on Instagram, the platform has become a breeding ground for unrealistic 
                        and unreachable beauty standards, that negatively impact individuals' and society's as a whole mental health, self-esteem, and body image
                    </h3>
                    <p> 
                        If you analyze users' behavior (or simply open offers in social networks), then you can conclude that users with
                        an appearance that often consists of the same elements receive more likes in social networks: 
                        smooth matte skin tone without problem areas and visible pores, a small, narrow nose, high cheekbones, and a defined jawline. <br>
                        A taut hourglass figure with pronounced abs and voluminous breasts and buttocks.
                        Long shiny hair, tanned skin, and naturally toned makeup.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to achieve wide recognition on Instagram,
                        people use various face filters to hide skin broblems and visible wide pores, use photoshop to make the waist look narrower and chest bigger to fit this "beautiful" picture on Instagram. <br>
                        But all this devalues â€‹our unique features of appearance and leads to dissatisfaction with our appearance in real life.

                    <h2>
                        How to solve these problems
                    </h2>
                    <h3 class="lead">
                        Instagram could introduce several digital features and changes to their app
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, Instagram should take responsibility and implement measures to regulate content that promotes
                        unrealistic beauty standards. They can do this by developing and enforcing policies that ban filters and photo-editing tools that 
                        promote unrealistic beauty standarts. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Secondly, Instagram can highlight and promote diverse and inclusive beauty standards by showcasing individuals
                        with different body types, skin tones, and features in the recommendation feed. This involves developing
                        algorithms that prioritize diverse content and partnering with influencers and creators who promote body positivity and inclusivity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thirdly, Instagram can allow viewers to disable filters to see the original content. 
                        This gives users the choice to view content in its original form and promotes transparency and authenticity on the platform..
                    </p>
                </div>
                <hr>
                <div class="post-preview">
                    <h2>
                        To untroduse these changes on Instagram into society
                    </h2>
                    <h3 class="lead">
                        Instagram could work with mental health experts, activists, and influencers to create and promote these above-mentioned features
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Instagram should communicate the changes to its users through various channels, such as in-app notifications,
                        blog posts, and social media. This helps to build awareness and understanding of the changes and promotes positive reception among the community.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <hr>
                <div class="post-preview">
                    <h2>
                        Possible challenges with implementing these digital solutions 
                    </h2>
                    <h3 class="lead">
                        A lot of users who are used to use filters and photoshop will start to resist the changes. Especially who don't recognize that this problem has a high value.
                        People can start to feel anxiety when they will want to post stories, reels, or posts.
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        And these changes and features will have a negative 
                        impact on advertisers who will lose the possibility to promote unrealistic beauty standards and Instagram will start to lose money because of this
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And it will also be more difficult for some bloggers to promote themselves on Instagram by creating filters for a more "beautiful" face.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <hr>
                <div class="post-preview">
                    <h2>
                        The beneficiaries of these solutions would be Instagram users, especially those who are vulnerable to the negative effects of the platform
                    </h2>
                    <h3 class="lead">
                        By promoting body positivity, Instagram can help create a more inclusive 
                        and positive environment for their users. This could lead to better mental health outcomes, increased engagement, and a more loyal user base.
